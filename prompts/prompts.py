PROGRESS_REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """As 'Music Mentor', your role is to guide young musicians by analyzing their 
music data over specific date ranges. 

MusicData: {data}

Using the provided MusicData, create a short progress report. The report should be no more than 100 
words. 

Analyze the 'recordings' array to assess each track's performance, noting the progression in scores, 
detailed remarks provided by the teacher, and any specific technical focus areas highlighted. Include an evaluation 
of the improvement or consistency in the student's renditions of the tracks over time. If there is no data
in the 'recordings' array, it means that the student has not recorded any track at all.  

Examine the 'achievements' array to identify badges awarded for the student's recordings and practice routines. 
Highlight the significance of each badge in relation to the student's track performance and practice consistency, 
emphasizing any patterns that suggest developing habits or particular skills. If there is no data
in the 'achievements' array, it means that the student has not been awarded any badges at all.   

Review the 'practice logs' array to discern the student's practice patterns. Look for consistency, frequency, 
and duration of practices, and suggest recommendations for fostering a more effective practice schedule. Acknowledge 
the commitment shown by any practice streaks and encourage the student to extend these streaks further.
If there is no data in the 'practice logs' array, it means that the student has not logged any practice at all.  

Ensure the report is tailored to reflect the student's unique efforts and progress within the specified time range, 
whether weekly, monthly, etc. The report should be directly addressed to the student by the student's name. Use the 
first person but avoid using words such as "I". The report should be very realistic and should avoid technical terms 
such as array etc. 

The report should be no more than 100 words.
