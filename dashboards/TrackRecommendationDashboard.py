            <p>Based on your recording submissions and scores, we've curated these <b>track recommendations</b> to aid in your skill development and address challenges from past sessions. Here's a guide to understanding and utilizing this information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Track Details</b>: Each track is accompanied by specific details. <b>Pay attention to the 'Level', 'Your Average Score', 'Track Average Score', 'Your Top Score', 'Track Top Score', and 'Track Threshold Score'</b>. These metrics provide insights into the track's difficulty and your performance in comparison to the overall and threshold scores.</li>
                <li><b>Color Coding</b>: Colors represent your performance status.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style='color: red;'><b>Red</b></span>: Indicates <b>areas needing improvement</b>, such as an average score below 80% of the threshold or high days on track.</li>
                        <li><span style='color: green;'><b>Green</b></span>: Signifies that you are <b>on track</b>, like an average score within 80% of the threshold.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Days on Track</b>: Reflects the time you've spent on each track. A higher number may indicate a need for more practice or different learning strategies.</li>
                <li><b>Last Remark</b>: Provides the latest feedback or note on your track performance.</li>
                <li><b>Assessments</b>: Each track comes with a tailored assessment based on your performance. This includes <b>suggestions and observations</b> aimed at helping you understand your current standing and how to improve. <b>Read these carefully</b> to gain insights into your learning journey.</li>
                <li><b>Action Steps</b>: <b>Choose a track</b> that aligns with your learning goals. <b>Consistent practice</b> and striving to surpass the threshold scores are crucial for your skill development and mastery of the track.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Important Note:</b> Once you select a track, make sure to <b>review your recordings and score trends</b> displayed below. Each recording for the selected track will be shown along with scores and reviews. <b>Listen to your own recordings</b> and <b>pay close attention to the reviews</b> to understand the corrections that need to be made. This <b>>self-review</b> process is vital for recognizing areas of improvement and tracking your progress over time.</p>
